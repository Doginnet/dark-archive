# Gemini Project Instructions - Interactive Music Archive

## Project Goal

The primary goal of this project is to transform the existing "dark-archive" website into an interactive music experience. The user wants to be able to not only listen to the tracks, but also to interact with them by combining different audio loops and visualizing the waveforms.

## Current Status

The project is currently a static website that displays a list of musical tracks and allows users to play them. The site is hosted on GitHub Pages at [https://doginnet.github.io/dark-archive/](https://doginnet.github.io/dark-archive/).

## User's Vision

The user has a clear vision for the future of this project. They want to create a "generative music" experience where users can:

*   **Deconstruct tracks:** Break down each track into its individual loops (e.g., drums, bass, melody).
*   **Create their own mixes:** Combine the loops in any way they want to create their own unique arrangements.
*   **Visualize the music:** See a real-time waveform visualization of the playing loops.

## Key Technologies

The following technologies have been identified as being important for this project:

*   **Web Audio API:** For precise audio synchronization and analysis.
*   **Tone.js (recommended):** A high-level library that simplifies the process of creating interactive music experiences with the Web Audio API.
*   **Canvas API (or a library like wavesurfer.js):** For waveform visualization.

## Next Steps

The next steps for this project are outlined in the `srs.md` file. The immediate focus should be on **Phase 1: The Core**, which involves implementing the basic loop playback and synchronization functionality.

When the user is ready to continue, I should be prepared to:

1.  **Assist with the implementation of the Web Audio API (or Tone.js).** This will be the most challenging part of the project, so I should be ready to provide clear and concise code examples.
2.  **Help the user create the UI for the loop controls.** This will involve creating a set of toggle switches or buttons for each loop.
3.  **Guide the user through the process of deploying the updated application to GitHub Pages.**

## Important Considerations

*   **The user is a musician, so they have a good understanding of the musical concepts involved.** I should use clear and concise language when explaining technical concepts.
*   **The user is also a developer, so they are comfortable with code.** I should provide code examples that are well-structured and easy to understand.
*   **The user is open to using libraries like Tone.js to simplify the development process.** I should be prepared to provide guidance on how to use these libraries.

## Session Management

*   At the end of each work session, update the `session_log.md` file with a summary of the progress made and the agreed-upon next steps.
